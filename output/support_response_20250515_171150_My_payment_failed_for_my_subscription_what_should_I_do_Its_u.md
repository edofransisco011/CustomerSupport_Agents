# Payment Failure Resolution Guide

**Hi there!** Let's help resolve your urgent payment issue. Here are immediate steps to try:

1️⃣ **Check Payment Details**  
   - Ensure your card number, expiration date, and CVV are entered correctly.  
   - Verify there are no typos or spaces in the card number.

2️⃣ **Payment Method Status**  
   - Confirm your card has sufficient funds.  
   - Check if your bank has blocked the transaction (common with new subscriptions).  
   - If using a virtual card, ensure it’s still active.

3️⃣ **Quick Fixes**  
   - Try a different payment method (e.g., another card or PayPal).  
   - Clear your browser cache/cookies and retry.  
   - Switch browsers or devices (e.g., mobile vs desktop).

**Still stuck?**  
➡️ Contact your bank to approve recurring transactions.  
➡️ Reply with "Escalate" if the issue persists, and we’ll prioritize your case.
